"Notes"
"Age-adjusted rates per 100,000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates are post-censal estimates based on the 2000 census estimated as of July 1, 2010. Since death rates are affected by the population composition of a given area, age-adjusted death rates should be used for comparisons between areas because they control for differences in population composition."

"Sources"
"Data are from the Multiple Cause of Death Files, 1999-2021, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program, accessed August 22, 2023."
